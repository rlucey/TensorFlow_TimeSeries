# TensorFlow_TimeSeries

**Using Tensorflow for Time Series Prediction**

**Purpose:** "To try and predict the past". Using historical data, chop off a time you would like to predict, train the model on the non-chopped data, and have it predict the time period that was chopped off. The model will have no knowledge of the chopped-off data. The model's prediction is then compared to the known data that was chopped off.
